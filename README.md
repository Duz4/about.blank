# about.blank
a simply html code that opens whatever link you type in an about:blank tab

for you unemployed people trying to bypass school blockers, if you visit the github page it'll show up on your history, but if you download the html then drag and drop it into your browser, it won't
the site can get blocked, but the html can't.

some sites won't work because they're encrypted, like google or youtube, but most of them work. 
DONT ADD "https://" before the link, it already does that (the code will read it as "https://https://[website].[domain]")
